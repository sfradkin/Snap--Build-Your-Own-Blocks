This is a customized version of Snap! in which I am attempting to provide
abstractions for using Tone.js inside of Snap! so that users can create
much more sophisticated sound.

As of 10-31-2015, there are 3 new blocks in the Tone category that will
let a user define notes within a simple synth and play them.
